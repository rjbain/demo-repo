I understand that there was a dispute about an invoice, but I hope that doesn't affect the high level of hosting support we've received up until now. We switched to TL hosting because we had to contact WSOL about outages (which happened frequently) and when we did they never seemed interested in giving us any answers. The disruption in service this morning seems to have been short, but if the notifications are correct then it means our failover failed as well, which gives us cause for concern. There were no code pushes early this morning, no syncs and if it were an app pool restart how could that have happened on both servers at the same time? I'm not asking for an exhaustive diagnosis or that you drop everything you're doing to troubleshoot, but some effort is expected.
